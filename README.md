Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

it is the process of analysing, designing, coding and developing softwares to meet needs and create solutions using technical approaches and with the use of computers. For an example softwares can used to handle large repeative set of processes to cut down on work time and actually make work easy for end-users or process operators.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Analysis: research is done on the problem and all necessary information is collected  
Planning: developer chooses the type of method and approach to work with in the project, the method could either be agile, traditional or waterfall
designing: in this process the graphic user interphase of the software is designed and prototypes are created
Coding: at this stage rules are created and set for the functionality of the software using a programming language like python, java script and the likes 
Testing: this is the process of checking for errors and debugging the code for anomalies 
Deployment: this is the final stage whereby the software is rolled out or distributed for use by the end user
Maintenance: this is the process where future updates, upgrades and changes are made on the software 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall: is sequential, you have to complete the first process before you can start working on the next proces eg you can't code and design at the same time. 
agile: it is flexible and easy to make changes while working on the project. You can work in any process at random e.g You can code, before the design prototype is created.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developers design apps, write code, test and fix bus and collaborate with team
Quality assurance egineer ensures that the softwares meets the required standard and checks if the software works as intended without any flaws

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE contains the tools for different programming laguages that are needed in oder to code like the VS code programme. 
VCS are for tracking, storing and collaborating with other programmers. github is an example of a VCS

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
